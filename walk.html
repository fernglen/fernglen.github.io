      <h1>Fernglen Garden and Bush Walk </h1>

      <div class="fgphotoL">
        <div><img class="embeddedImage" src="images/entrance.jpg" alt="Entrance Gates to Fernglen"></div>
        <div span class="caption">Fernglen entrance gate</div>
      </div>

      <p>Fernglen has well maintained walking tracks that provide an excellent opportunity to observe many interesting species. As you enter the gates to Fernglen there is a kiosk that provides general information about New Zealand flora, a history of Fernglen with notes on the different groups of plants to be seen and a plan of the region drawn to scale. <a href="assets/print_map.pdf" target=_blank>A self-guided tour is available.</a> Take an instructional guide from a tray in the kiosk. Follow the directions on the instruction guide to marked numbers within the garden, each one tells a little about the 26 specific plants/trees of interest.  Within the walk is an active water way running over mountain rocks, inspired by Muriel Fisher's many walks in the Aoraki/Mt Cook region.</p>

      <p>Toilet facilities are available by the entrance to the Education Centre.</p>

      <p>The main entrance is through a gate marked with Fernglen. There is a carpark opposite.  It is accessed by travelling down Kauri Road, carrying over the lip of Kauri Road towards Hebe Place.</p>

      <p>An access for those less mobile is at the cul-de-sac of Kauri Road at the top driveway which leads to the grassed area.</p>
