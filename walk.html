      <h1>Fernglen Garden and Bush Walk </h1>

      <div class="fgphotoL">
        <div><img src="images/entrance.jpg" alt="Entrance Gates to Fernglen" width="250" height="156" border="0"></div>
        <div span class="caption">Fernglen Entrance Gate </div>
      </div>

      <p>Fernglen has well maintained walking tracks that provide an excellent opportunity to observe many interesting species. As you enter the gates to Fernglen there are four panels that provide general information about New Zealand flora, a history
        of Fernglen with notes on the different groups of plants to be seen and a plan of the region drawn to scale. </p>

      <p>The main walk is down the Kauri Ridge where kauri trees of approximately 300 years old can be seen. At the bottom there is a fine stand of Nikau palms and the New Zealand begonia
        <SPAN class=botanic_name>Elatostema</SPAN> carpets the ground. This was introduced from the Waitakere ranges in the 1920&rsquo;s. Dominating this area is a magnificent rimu estimated to be a seedling at the time of Captain Cook's first visit to New Zealand in 1769. It provides accommodation
        for a host of epiphytes
        <SPAN class=botanic_name>Collospermun.</SPAN> You can choose to return and ascend a steep ridge back to the gazebo or if you desire a longer walk, at the bottom of the ridge, cross the boardwalk and ascend steps which will bring you out into a grove of young Kauri which were funded by
        the Birkenhead Rotary Club.</p>

      <p>Toilet facilities are available by the entrance to the Education Centre. We ask you to please sign the visitor's book in the gazebo before starting Walks. </p>
